This can be especially useful in preventing overfitting when data is scarce.

    "**Task 2.2 (5 points):** What causes the metrics to exhibit lower values for the imbalanced dataset compared to those in homework 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with imbalanced datasets, standard metrics such as accuracy can be misleading. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bias Towards the Majority Class**: Traditional classifiers, when trained on imbalanced datasets, tend to be biased towards the majority class. This is because the classifier will achieve a high accuracy by simply predicting the majority class for all inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Misleading Accuracy**: In imbalanced datasets, even a naive model that always predicts the majority class can have a high accuracy. For instance, if 95% of the data belongs to Class 0 and 5% to Class 1, a model that always predicts Class 0 will have an accuracy of 95%.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loss of Important Data**: The minority class, although less frequent, may represent critical data. In many real-world scenarios like fraud detection or rare disease diagnosis, the minority class is more important. If the model fails to classify the minority class correctly due to the imbalance, it can lead to significant consequences, even if the overall accuracy is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Performance Metrics**: Precision, recall, and F1 score can also be affected by class imbalance. For example, if the minority class (e.g., Class 1) is of interest, a low recall indicates many false negatives, meaning many actual positive instances are predicted as negative. This can be problematic in applications where detecting the positive class is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome these challenges and get a true sense of a model's performance on imbalanced datasets, it's essential to look beyond accuracy and consider other metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC). Additionally, techniques like resampling (oversampling or undersampling), using different evaluation metrics, or adopting algorithms that are designed to handle imbalance can be applied.\n"

    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **F1-score**:\n",
    "    - **Definition**: The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a balance between the two. When diagnosing a serious disease, it's crucial because both false negatives and false positives have serious implications.\n",

    "5. **Balanced Accuracy**:\n",
    "    - **Definition**: Balanced accuracy is the average of recall and specificity. It provides a balanced measure of the test's performance across both positive and negative cases. In situations where there's a class imbalance or where both types of errors have significant implications, balanced accuracy can be a more informative metric.\n",

    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "- **Precision**: Of all the patients the test identified as positive for disease Z, about \\(70.6\\%\\) actually had the disease.\n",
    "- **Recall**: The test was able to correctly identify \\(80\\%\\) of the patients who actually had disease Z.\n",
    "- **F1-score**: This score, being the harmonic mean of precision and recall, indicates a balanced measure of the test's accuracy and its ability to detect positive cases. It's at \\(75\\%\\), suggesting a relatively good balance between precision and recall.\n",
    "- **Specificity**: The test correctly identified approximately \\(85.7\\%\\) of the patients who did not have disease Z.\n",
    "- **Balanced Accuracy**: This metric gives an average accuracy across both positive and negative cases, and it's at \\(82.9\\%\\). This suggests that the test performs fairly well across both classes.\n",
